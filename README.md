Welcome ðŸ¤˜ 

I'm a Frontend Developer who wants to create digital experiences that impact people's lives. 

With a degree in Psychology and early beginnings internationally rooted in Music, events production and subculture, I spent my previous life achieving a well-rounded profile as Creative Producer and Project Manager. After about 10 years in the entertainment sector, in 2021 I transitioned into tech and trained as Frontend Web Developer at Ironhack, Amsterdam. 

When I'm not coding, I'm probably learning something new or making somethikng new. I love to build and restore furniture and objects, I am obessed with pleasant visual imageniry, analogue phorography, flea markets, music and roller skating, among many other things! Because I'm a jack of all trades and master of some!

On this account you will find the projects completed during my studies at Ironhack, for now! Soon to be fillup up with some stuff from my personal universe and the work projects I'm proud of.

Stay tuned ðŸ’‹
